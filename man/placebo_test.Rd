\arguments{
\item{F}{A numeric matrix representing the reference domain outcome for treated and control units.
The first row is the treated unit, and the rest are control units.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix representing the target domain outcome.}

\item{t_max}{Integer. Number of pre-treatment time periods for \code{F}.}

\item{s_max}{Integer. Number of post-treatment time periods for \code{Y}.}

\item{i_max}{Integer. Total number of units.}

\item{w}{A numeric weight vector representing the synthetic control weights for the treated unit.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix of covariates in the target domain.}

\item{Z}{A numeric matrix of covariates in the reference domain.}

\item{dr}{Integer. Number of covariates in \code{Z}.}

\item{dt}{Integer. Number of covariates in \code{X}.}

\item{eta_Z}{Numeric. Default is \code{0.1}.}

\item{eta_X}{Numeric. Default is \code{0.1}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{plot_F}{A \code{ggplot} object showing placebo effects in the reference domain (\code{F}).}
\item{plot_Y}{A \code{ggplot} object showing placebo effects in the target domain (\code{Y}).}
}
The plots visualize the difference between observed and synthetic outcomes across placebo-treated control units.
}
\description{
This function runs placebo tests by treating each control unit as if it were the treated unit
and estimating the synthetic control weights. It compares the actual outcome against the
synthetic counterfactual outcome for both the reference outcome \code{F} and the target outcome \code{Y}.
}
\details{
For each control unit, the function constructs a synthetic version of that unit using the other control units.
It calculates the synthetic control effect as the difference between observed and synthetic outcomes.
These placebo effects are plotted alongside the actual treated unitâ€™s effect to assess significance.
Synthetic control weights are optimized using \code{optimize_w_ipop()} and \code{find_best_B()} with constraints on covariate fit.
