\title{Compute Synthetic Weighted Averages for Selected Columns}
\usage{
compute_synth_avg(data, w, covariates, time_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing a 'year' column and numeric columns of interest.}

\item{w}{A numeric vector of weights (should sum to 1), corresponding to control units.}

\item{covariates}{A character vector of column names for which to compute the weighted average.}

\item{time_value}{The target time (year, month, or date) for filtering the data.}
}
\value{
A one-row data frame containing the synthetic weighted averages for the selected columns.
}
\description{
This function computes the synthetic group's weighted averages for the specified columns
within a given time-related variable (e.g., year, month, or date).
}
\examples{
compute_synth_avg(data, w = c(0.5, 0.5), covariates = c("median_income", "median_age"), year = 2021)
